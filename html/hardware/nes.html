		The Family Computer was realised in Japan in 1983, it was a revolutionary 8-bit console games 
		made by <a href="../games/nintendo.html">Nintendo</a>, which had started to develop  video games since the 70s. When the console come in the USA in 1985
 		it was renamed as the Nintendo Entertainment System or <b>NES</b>, the best selling console of those years, the console which 
 		solved the <a href="../games/videogame_crash.html">video game crash</a> of 1983. The success of the NES is due to its lineup and its revolutionary hardware.

	<h2>Inside the NES</h2>
		<p>
			The America, Europe, Japan and Corea version of the NES uses a <b>8-bit microprocessor</b> Ricoh (a Japanese multinational) 2A03 with a clock speed of 1.79 MHz.
			It is a variant of the MOS 6502, a microprocessor invented by MOS Technology in 1975, a not too much expensive 
			CPU in the 70s and an economic processor in the 80s, the age of the NES. <br>
			<br>
			The NES has <b>2 KB of RAM</b> and <b>2 KB of video ram</b>, which can be increased by a game cartridge. There are 16 KB of free space in the console 
			to storage files as gaming progresses; while the entire game is stored in the cartridge which can have a storage between the 8 KB and 
			1 MB. <br>
			<br>
			The <a href="evolution_gpu.html">Picture Processing Unit</a> (PPU) was made by Ricoh and it operates at 5.37 MHz with 256 bytes to
			store object attribute memory. The colour palette is made form 64 colours (6 bytes) but it is possible to use only 25 colours at a time.
			The resolution of the NES is far away from the modern standard resolution, it is just 256 by 240 pixels.

	<h2> Memory management controller </h2> 
	
		<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 300px"><a href="#1"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/MMC3_NES.jepg.jpg" alt="MMC3"></a><div class="caption">MMC3</div></div>
		
		<p>
			This hardware is more than acceptable for a console game sold in the 80s with a prize of $125-$150, but, to develop 
			more complex and large games, Nintendo and videogames developer built the Memory management controller or the Multi-memory controllers (MMC), 
			a chip which is able to <b>extend the memory of the NES</b>. <br>
			<br>
			Nintendo, for the first time, granted to third-party companies the develop of the games for its console, the NES.
			That's why the MMCs was developed by Nintendo and games company which built their games around the models of MMC. <br>
		
			For example the game cartridge of the first The Legend Of Zelda (1987) uses the MMC1, which increase the ram.
			While the MCC3 increases the Picture Processing Unit (PPU) RAM and the RAM dedicated to the audio, increasing the complexity of 
			the graphic and the songs of the game; it was used to develop the famous video game Super Mario Bros 2. <br>
			<br>
			Nintendo created fantastic new games, and the gaming market was able to improve without changing the NES
			and its hardware every years.  In this way the video game crash of the 1983 was exceeded. <br>

	<h2> NES gamepad </h2>

		<p>
			A gamepad is an external controller for consoles. It is usually built to be used with 2 hands, 
			it is not bonded to the console, but it can send inputs (pressing a button) to the console 
			with a cable (or the modern Bluetooth). <br>
			<br>
			The gamepad of the NES was a new and more complex kind of controller, it is the first controller developed for 
			a console with the <b>crosses directional</b> (or d-pad); This technology was invented by Gumpei Yokoi (A Nintendo developer), 
			while he was developing the first portable console Nintendo named <a href="../games/nintendo.html">Game & Watch</a>. <br>
			<br>
			The NES's gamepad has 4 buttons (2 for playing, 2 for selecting) and the crosses directional. This squared pad is the first 
			gamepad which presents the same commands map of a mobile arcade, that is the d-pad (or joystick) on the left and the buttons 
			on the right, the common setting of all the present console's gamepads.  <br>
