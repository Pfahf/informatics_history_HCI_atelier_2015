				<h1>How was data stored in the 80's?</h1>
				<h2>Here's how.</h2>
				<p>In the <b>1980</b>, the IBM 3380 was born: it looked like a refrigerator, weighed almost 250 Kg, and its price is 40.000$, nowadays compared with almost 115.000$. It's the first Gigabyte hard drive, actually its capacity is 2,52 GB (2x1,26 GB); it could read or write 3 MB per second and had a mean access time of 16 ms.<br>
				Then, in the same year, the Seagate produced the ST-506, a 5.25 hard drive for 5 MB: Its price was 1.500 $. The similar ST-412 had doubled the capacity and the read-write rate just changing the encoding.<br>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 200px"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/cd.png" alt="CD Logo" ><div class="caption" style="height:15px">The Compact Disc Logo</div></div>
				After the half of <b>1982</b>, the first Compact Disc (CD) was produced in a Philips and DuPont's factory: The Music world start to sell music thanks to CDs: 52nd Street, recorded by Billy Joel was sold with the player since October of this year.<br>
				Have you ever asked yourself why the maximum capacity of a CD is about 74' and 33''? At the beginning, Phillips and Sony co-worked together to define a new international standard: ideas were usually contrasting, but on the capacity of this device everybody was fine: 60 minutes was the chosen standard.
				Soon the capacity was brung to the actual 74' and 33'' because this is the length of the Beethoven's ninth symphony played by Furtw&auml;ngler at Bayreuth's Festival in 1951.<br>
				
				<br>In the <b>1983</b>, the Rodime produced the RO352, the first 3.5" hard drive: its capacity was about 10 MB. Some say Rodime patented the 3.5" standard, even if a 3.5" floppy drive was announced by Tandon and Shugart, first seen at Fall Joint Computer Conference.<br>
				<br>
				<div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 200px"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/scsi.png" alt="SCSI Logo" ><div class="caption" style="height:15px">The SCSI Logo</div></div>
				If this picture on the left reminds something to you, it's not the first time you see the SCSI logo. It's the <b>1986</b> and SCSI becames a set of defined commands, protocols and electrical and optical devices. The goal of using this standard is to see each device as a generic device. The thought at the basis of the creation of this standard is that is easier to control one unique device instead of thousands of different devices: SCSI can "hide" the complexity of phisical formats.<br>			
				<br>
				<b>1988</b>: Terry Johnson founded PrairieTek; Terry, who had pioneered the transitions to smaller and smaller Hard Drives, reduced the size but not the capacity: the perfect fit for laptop computers. One of the most innovative products of the PrairieTek was the model 220: 20 MB made of 2 2,5" Disks.<br>
				Nowadays, each Laptop contains a 2,5" Hard Disk Drive.
