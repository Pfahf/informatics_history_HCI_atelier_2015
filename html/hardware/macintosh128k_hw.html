				<p>The Macintosh. The beginning of an era for Apple. When its idea wasn't born yet, <a href="Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> and the manager of the project Jef Raskin were arguing if the Macintosh should have been cheap or a high-quality Personal Computer.<br>
				Michael Scott, Apple CEO, brought in Jobs' hands the whole project: from this moment, the Macintosh started to change.<br>
				In Steve's point of view, everything should have been nice to see and simple: From the software to the hardware, even internal components.<br>
				In the 1983, Steve Jobs started to think which could be the perfect advertisement for the product that would have brought Apple to the success: here above you can see the chosen commercial: it will be considered as the best advertisement ever.

				The girl represents the arrive of the Macintosh on the market that should free all the computer users from conformism.
				<br>
				The Macintosh had a 8MHz Processor (<a href="images/computersgraph.png">Here</a> you can see a comparation graph with some similiar Personal Computers), 128 kB RAM (when the standard was only 64 kB), a 9 " monochromatic display with a quality of the image of 72 PPI.<br>
				A 400 kB floppy was considered as ample and many users preferred to lock the write on the floppy which contained the Operating System (the Mac OS) and using a second floppy for personal data.<br>
				It didn't have fans inside: Steve Jobs couldn't stand noisy fans and was a supporter of silent computers.<br>
				in the rear of its beige case, we could find connectors for the <a href="keyboards_hw.html">keyboard</a> (without arrows keys or numeric tab to force the user to use the mouse), the mouse, the printer, the modem, an external floppy disk and a monophonic speaker.<br>
				Apple wanted to use specific connectors to avoid people to use the Macintosh with a non-Apple monitor: This strategy is still used nowadays with the most of ports or cables used by Apple products.<br>
