				<p>Capcom is one of the most famous Japanese software house in the world. </p>
				<p> This society derives from the <b>Sambi Co.</b>(1981) that was formed by the union between two former companies: <b>I.R.M Corporation</b> (founded on May 30, 1979) and <b>Japan Capsule Computers Co., Ltd.</b>, that were working in the field of manufacturing and distributing electronic game machines.<br>
				  Only in 1983 <b>Capcom Co.</b> was established in order to take over the internal sales department. </p>
				<p>
               In 1989 Capcom Co. finally established its supremacy over Sambi Co. and the company took this name: <b>Capcom</b>, which derives from ‘<b>CAP</b>sule <b>COM</b>puters’. <br> The name was created to distinguish the arcade machines that were being created from the personal computers that were growing fast during that decade. <br>The idea of ‘Capsule’ derives from the idea of Capcom to link its game software to a “<b>capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun</b>”; the figure of the capsule could also be associated with the idea of creating a shell in order to protect both their customers and their products from being hacked or copied.
               
              <h2>The most famous games</h2>
                <p>Although Capcom began producing <a href="arcadegames.html">coin-operated games</a>, the real first video game was published in 1984 and named <i>Vulgus</i>, in 1985 was the moment of <i>1942</i>. 
Since then Capcom decided to develop itself in the market of <a href="console_generations.html">home console video games</a>, too: the absolute masterpieces were <i>Street Fighter</i>, which started a series of fighting games, and <i>Mega Man</i>.

               <h3 class="subP"><i>Vulgus</i></h3>
               <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/vulgus.png" style="width:25%" alt="screen"></a>
                <p class="subP">Released in 1984, is a <b>vertically scrolling shooter video game</b>. The name derives from Latin and it means ‘common people’.<br>
The gameplay is very simple: there is a <b>spaceship</b> that has to destroy all the incoming enemies. The player has two weapons at his disposal: a primary weapon with infinite ammunition and a supply of bombs that are collectible during the game in the form of “pow” icons.<br>
The game is, in theory, <b>infinite</b>, but it becomes harder as the time passes and it will not stop until the player loses his three lives.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

				<h3 class="subP"><i>1942</i></h3>
                <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/1942.jpg" alt="screen" style="width:25%"></a>
                <p class="subP">Released in 1984, is a <b>vertically scrolling shoot 'em up video game</b>. It was the first of a long series of <b>19xx games</b>.<br> The goal of the game is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet, so the player has to go through enemy planes, avoiding their fire, performing a roll or “loop-the-loop".
As in <i>Vulgus</i>, the player may collect a series of power-ups.<br>
<i>1942</i> eclipsed the company's preceding titles and became one of Capcom's hallmark games throughout the <a href="arcade_golden_age.html">arcade era</a>.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                
                <h3 class="subP"><i>Commando</i></h3>
                <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/commando.jpg" style="width:25%" alt="screen"></a>

                <h3 class="subP"><i>Mega Man</i></h3>
                <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/mega_man.jpg" style="width:25%" alt="screen"></a>
                <p class="subP">Released in 1987, is a <b>platform video game</b> in which Mega Man is an android called Rock, created as a lab assistant by the scientist Dr. Light.<br> Following treachery by Dr. Wily, Rock was converted into a battle robot to defend the world from Wily's violent robotic threats, so he became Mega Man.<br>
The game is divided into <b>six levels</b> and it has four different endings (that can be played arbitrary), the player has also two indicators provided in order to check the energy of Mega-Man and the level of his weapons that can be improved by taking power-ups around the levels.</p><br>
                
                <h3 class="subP"><i>Street Fighter</i></h3>
