				<h1>Midway Games</h1>
				<p>
				The company was founded as <b>Midway Manufacturing</b> in 1958 and was known mainly as a developer of pinball machines.
				In 1969, the company got acquired by <b>Bally Manufacturing Corporation</b>, this acquisition led to their big success in the
				videogame industry.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
				</p>
				<h2>The start </h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%"><a href="#4"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/Bally_Astrocade.jpg" alt="Bally astrocade"><div class="caption">The Bally Astrocade</div></a></div>
				<p>
				In <b>1973</b> Midway moved into the videogame market developing and publishing arcade games, in <b>1977</b> the company entered the consumer
				market by releasing the <b>Bally Home Library Computer</b> later renamed <b>Bally Astrocade</b>, wich became
				the only game system to be developed by the company. The game system was discontinued in 1985.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
				</p>
				<h2>The Success</h2>
				<p>
				The major success of the company came in <b>1978</b>, when it established a strong connection with <a href="arcadegames.html">Taito</a>, wich Midway Games to publish
				some of the most successful games ever like <i>Space Invaders</i> and later <a href="namco.html"><i>Pac-Man</i></a> (in 1980) and it's unauthorized
				sequel <i>Ms.Pac-Man</i> in 1981.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1981 Bally merged its pinball division with Midway to form the
				<b>Bally/Midway Manufacturing</b> division and confirmed <b>Midway</b> as the the leading producer of arcade video games in North America.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				</p>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%"><a href="#5"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/Addams.jpg" alt="Bally astrocade"><div class="caption">An Addams Family pinball</div></a></div>
				<p>
				In 1988 the <b>Bally/Midway</b> division of <b>Bally</b> was purchased by <b>WMS Industries Inc.</b>, wich obtained 
				the right to use the "Bally" brand for its pinball games. Under <b>WMS</b> ownership, Midway initially continued to produce arcade games 
				under the Bally/Midway label, but in <b>1991</b> Midway absorbed <b>Williams'</b> videogame division and
				started making arcades under its name. In 1992, Midway produced <i>The Addams Family</i> pinball, wich became the
				<b>best selling</b> pinball of all time.
				</p>
				<h2>The fall</h2>
				<p>
				Despite this leadership in the '70s and '80s, Midway never really entered successfully in the home console market neither as a <b>console manufacturer</b>
				nor as a <b>video game producer</b>, so with the fell of arcade game's popularity in the '90s and 2000s Midway started to suffer heavy financial
				losses until they failed for <b>bankruptcy</b> in 2009, selling all their assets after a decade of struggles.
