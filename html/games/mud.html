					A <b>MUD</b> is a sub-genre of the <b>Role-playing video game</b> category. It stands for 
					<b>Multi-User Dungeon</b>, which means that these types of games consist of <b>dungeon crawling</b>, 
					<b>role-playing</b>, level interaction and sometimes there is also some <b>player versus player</b>.
					 MUD games were mainly played on computers as <b>text-based</b> games, which is a game where the player 
					interacts by writing <b>actions</b> to perform on the <a href="pc_gaming.html">computer</a> like north or attack. On the 
					computer screen is described the location of the player and the situation he is in with multiple possible 
					actions he can perform.</p> <p> Since these games are inspired by the the <b>fantasy tabletop role-playing game</b> 
					calles <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> (1974), they tend to mostly be <b>fantasy</b> themed. Others can be 
					<b>sci-fy</b> themed or based on books and popular movies. The goal of these games may vary but they are mainly 
					about <b>slaying monsters</b>, <b>exploring</b> dungeons, completing <b>quests</b> and so forth.</p>

					MUD games go back to 1975 where <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i> was created by <b>Will Crowther</b>
					on a DEC PDP-10 <b>computer</b>. It became very popular as an <b>adventure game</b> that was later quickly followed 
					by another MUD by Crowther called <i>Adventure</i>. This marks the beginning of MUD's because after the release of 
					<i>Adventure</i>, a group of <b>MIT</b> students that were inspired by this game wrote in 1977 a game called 
					<i>Zork</i>. It quickly gained in popularity on the <a href="../internet/ARPANET.html"> <b>ARPANET</b></a> and became one of the most important MUD game. The
					creators of this game later founded <a href="infocom.html"><b>Infocom</b></a> with other programmers and released a series of MUD games mainly 
					<i>Zork</i> sequels like <i>Zork III: The Dungeon Master</i> (1982).</p> <p> However while Infocom released more and more games,
					a student in Essex University in the UK called <b>Roy Trubshaw</b> not only defined this sub-genre by creating a game called 
					<i>MUD</i>, but with the help from <b>Richard Bartle</b>, created in 1980, the first multiplayer <b>online</b> 
					role-playing game that ran on the University's <b>network</b>. After this event MUD games began being 
					<b>commercialised</b> and ported into other systems. Another trend later came which consisted of <b>gaming sites</b>, where people 
					could retrieve MUD game <b>codes</b> to play them on their computers. An example is the site called <i>Gamers World</i> 
					that was created by <b>Mark Jacobs</b> in 1984. In this site you could retrieve game codes to play MUD's like <i>Aradath</i> (1985).
					Until 1991, MUD games just kept gaining in popularity for their online factor and their text-based adventures inspired by famous books 
					like <b>J. R. R. Tolkien's</b> <i>The Hobbit</i> (1937) or <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> series.</p>
				<h2>Different types of MUD's</h2>
					<p>
					Not every MUD game is fantasy based, as the themes, <b>gameplay</b> and 
					the <b>game types</b> all vary. The most common game type is the basic <b>Hack and Slash</b> which involves slaying monsters while 
					exploring dungeons or other areas which almost always contains a <b>boss</b> that you need to beat in order proceed. In these games 
					there was usually some <b>looting</b> and <b>experience</b> gaining in order to <b>level up</b> to upgrade <b>stats</b> like 
					attack or health. Another popular game style was <b>player versus player</b> where players would fight each other in 
					order to win. These games were mainly found in University campuses because they were played on the University's network.
					Then there was a style that started in the 1980s called <b>graphical MUD's</b>. They were basically MUD's that contained 
					actual <b>pixel art</b> instead of just text on a screen. The player would then be able to see his environment however this trend just 
					started with the game <i>Habitat</i> but this style didn't get much attention for a decade. Other game styles are:
					<ul>
								<li><b>Roleplaying MUD's</b> where the player would role play a character.</li>
								<li><b>Social MUD's</b> where players would interact with each other</li>
								<li><b>Educational MUD's</b> where the game would be created to educate the player</li>
					
								
					</ul>
					These were the most common MUD's, there were however more because these types of games aren't contained in a set category or theme.
