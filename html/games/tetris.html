					This game is a russian <b>puzzle</b> game that involves placing <b>geometrical</b> shapes called 
					<b>Tetronimos</b> in a certain way so that they fit each other to cover rows without an empty space 
					between these shapes.There are <b>seven</b> different shapes that will fall increasingly faster from the top of the screen, 
					each shape composed of <b>four squares</b>. 
					the player will then be able to <b>move</b> these shapes right or left and also <b>rotate</b> these 
					shapes 4 times by <b>90 degrees</b>.If a row gets filled up by ten squares the row disappears and the player gains points.  
					However as soon as these Tetronimos touch another one they <b>stop</b> moving, this means that 
					if the shapes reach the top of the screen the player looses.

					<p>
					<i>Tetris</i> was made in Russia, by <b>Alexey Pajitnov</b> in 1985.
					After playing a pentominoes game he decided to create <i>Tetris</i> on an <b>Electronica 60</b> 
					at the <b>Moscow Academy of Science's Computer Center</b>. After it's release the game began being ported 
					into other systems like the <b>IBM PC</b> rising in popularity. After a while the PC version spread to other 
					places like <b>Hungary</b> where Hungarian programmers ported it into the <b>Apple II</b> and the <b>Commodore 64</b> in 1986.
					This game attracted the attention of <b>Robert Stein</b>, the president of 
					<b>the British software house Andromeda</b>, who had the intent of getting the rights of <i>Tetris</i>. 
					However, without telling Pajitnov, he sold the rights of <i>Tetris</i> to <b>Mirrorsoft UK</b> and its USA affiliate.
					Stein later asked the Russians for a <b>signed proof</b> of the transaction of the rights but they refused so he decided that 
					he needed to steal this game from them by claiming that it was made by the Hungarian programmers. 
					</p>
					<p>
					While this was happening, <i>Tetris</i> kept getting more and more popular as was able to be played by almost any 
					<b>home computer</b>. Months go by and more and more companies get their hands on <i>Tetris</i>, 
					whether it's on <a href="pc_gaming.html">computer</a>, 
					<a href="arcadegames.html">arcade</a>, handheld or even <a href="console_generations.html">console</a>. Not only was it the most 
					popular computer game at the time but it also had a huge hit on the 
					arcade version in <b>Japan</b> by gaining the <b>Game of the Year</b> award from <b>Gamest Award</b>. But Stein could not get 
					his hands on legitimate <i>Tetris</i> rights, even the <b>Soviet government</b> got the rights for ten years. Still a lot of companies 
					like <a href ="sega.html"><b>Sega</b></a> or <a href="nintendo.html"><b>Nintendo</b></a> had different rights on <i>Tetris</i> like arcade 
					rights or home console rights, however this just created a big dispute between these companies.
					But this is just a <b>brief</b> summary of the whole story because it is actually very long and a lot more <u><a href="#3">intricate</a></u> and consists mainly 
					of the fight between companies to get their hands the a signed right of <i>Tetris</i> from the authors.
					</p>

					Since a dozen of companies had their hands on <i>Tetris</i>, this game became extremely popular generating a lot 
					of money, but because of how much money they could make off of <i>Tetris</i>, companies began competing with each 
					other on different <b>hardwares</b>. Big companies like <b>Nintendo</b>, <b>Sega</b> or even <a href="atari.html"><b>Atari Games</b> </a>
					had rights over <i>Tetris</i> and created their own version of it on <a href="handheld.html">handhelds</a>, arcades or consoles. These companies 
					fought over the rights to this game, for the right of the home console, arcade or handheld. They all wanted to 
					have control over this game because of it's fame. However there were big hits in certain hardwares like 
					the <b>Game boy's</b> <i>Tetris</i> in 1989 that sold over 33 million copies and is the most popular version of <i>Tetris</i>
					or the Sega's arcade version which was widely popular in Japan in 1988.</p> <p> Between these different versions there were 
					unique features to make the game stand out from the rest like new <b>game modes</b> or a particular point counting system.
					Not only were features added but also the <b>music</b> wasn't always the same for every version. The most popular one was 
					from the Game Boy, it's a Russian folk song called <b>"Korobeiniki"</b> that is featured in almost every game so far. However, 
					other versions had different songs, the <b>NES</b> version had it's soundtrack from the <b>nutcracker</b> while Atari's 
					soundtrack was composed by <b>Brad Fuller</b>. In the end, Tetris became one of the most <b>popular</b> and <b>influential</b> game 
					of it's era that was also featured a large array of different hardwares and owned by many companies even though Alexey Pajitnov is the one that 
					legitimately owned the rights to <i>Tetris</i>.
