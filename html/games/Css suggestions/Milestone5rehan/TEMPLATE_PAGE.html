Fourteen months later that night, this game was published, and became one of the most important arcade game of the World.<br> The purpose of the game is to make Pac-Man eat all the pills without being caught by the four ghosts. <br> This game was formerly considered "too nice to become popular", things proves that this consideration was absolutely wrong!
                            <i>Pac-Man</i> is regarded as the most famous game by Namco. Nowadays the little yellow character is still recognised as the mascot of the Japanese company.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
