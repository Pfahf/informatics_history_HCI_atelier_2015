                <p> One of the front-runner during <a href="arcade_golden_age.html">the golden age of arcade video games</a> was certainly Namco.<br>
                
                Founded in 1955 by <b>Masaya Nakamura</b><a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, this company was formerly named <b>Nakamura Manufacturing</b>  and used to sell children’s rides in <b>Tokyo, Japan</b>.<br>
                
                Three years later, as this company was expanding, it took the name that will soon become unforgettable during the following decades: <b>Namco</b> (<b>N</b>akamura <b>A</b>musement machine <b>M</b>anufacturing <b>CO</b>mpany).<br>
                
                In 1974 Namco, after a fight against <a href="sega.html">Sega</a>, managed to buy Atari Japan, that in that period was having a financial problem. Namco accessed the arcade world. Soon, two subsidiaries "<b>Namco Enterprises Asia Ltd, Hong Kong</b>" and "<b>Namco America Inc., California</b>" were opened.<br>
                Another important step was done during 1985, after the <a href="videogame_crash.html">video game crash</a>. Atari split into two corporate entities: Atari Corporation, which took over the home computer and console hardware business, and Atari Games, which retained the arcade game business.<br>
