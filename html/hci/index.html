<h1>HCI - Human computer interaction</h1>

<b>Human–computer interaction (HCI)</b> researches the design and use of computer technology, focusing particularly on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that lets humans interact with computers in novel ways. The interface is crucial to facilitating the interaction between humans and the computers. 
<br>
<b>CHI (Computer-Human Interaction)</b> here has a narrower focus than HCI; CHI is associated mainly with computer science.

<h1>HF&E - Human factors and ergonomics</h1>

<b>Human factors and ergonomics (HF&E)</b>, also known as comfort design, functional design, and user-friendly systems, is the practice of designing products, systems or processes to take proper account of the interaction between them and the people who use them. 
The International Ergonomics Association defines HF&E as follows:
“Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.”

	<h1>Computer Graphics: Realism and Interaction</h1>
	<p>
	1965 marked the beginning of a shift in computer science research, while most computers researchers continued 
	their developpement on high end <b>computer graphics systems</b> built on the DEC PDP-1 and PDP-7, some 
	researchers started working on a new section of computer science because they realised that the machines 
	required to use these graphics systems (like the DEC PDP-1 or PDP-7) were too <b>expensive</b> for the common 
	man, the cost of their high-resolution display alone was equivalent to more than US$100.000
	</p>
	<p>
	So in 1973 the new computer system called the Xerox Alto signaled the arrival of a new section of 
	computer graphics which would focus of the <b>interaction</b> between the man and the machine. This 
	was due to the fact that this machine was not capable to support high-end graphics research however 
	it could be used for research on <b>graphical interfaces</b> which would lead to more <b>affordable</b> and
	interactive personal machines that also supported good graphic systems.
	</p>
	<p>
	This lead to the computer graphics department being split into two main sections, most researches continued 
	working on better graphic systems run on expensive machines, while others started working on graphic 
	systems which could run on more affordable machines. William Newman, co-author in 1973 of  
	<i>Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics</i>, describes this change in computer graphics research as the 
	difference between "<b>realism</b>" and "<b>interaction</b>".
	</p>
	<p>
	Thus this new field of computer interaction marked the prominent start of the arrival of affordable 
	personal machines for the everyday man who would not need prior training to operate this machine 
	with ease which is described as "<b>user oriented design</b>", this would create a good symbiosis between 
	man and machine.

		<h1>Future of HCI - A glimpse on the future</h1><br>

		The pervasive computing is the growing trend of embedding processors in everyday life objects.
		The main goal of pervasive computing is to make the technology simple to use and present everywhere in order to
		integrate the physical word with the virtual world.
		Mark Weiser, a chief scientist at Xerox PARC, coined the term in 1988 and almost 30 years later we are witnessing 
		a third wave in computing. First there were the mainframes, each shared by lots of people. Then personal computer arrived and every person had the possibility
		to use a computer at home, school and so on.
		Finally we are going to a world where there are many tiny digital devices for each person, all around him.<br>

		Mark Weiser proposed three categories of pervasive system devices:
		- Table: wearable centimetre sized devices
		- Pads: Hand-held decimetre sized devices
		- Boards: Metre sized interactive display devices<br>
