				<h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
				
				<h2>Xerox Alto</h2>
				
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 20%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/alto.jpg" alt="the Xerox Alto"><div class="caption">the Xerox Alto</div></div></a>
				
				
				<p>
				In the 1970s, the <a href="../../internet/xerox_parc.html">PARC</a>, Palo Alto Research Center, was
				founded by Xerox. Many important people came to the PARC
				to work on different kinds of projects. One of their
				first products was the Alto. Completed in 1973, the
				Xerox Alto was the first computer to have a mouse and a
				graphical user interface, inspired by <a href="../companies_people/Douglas_Engelbart.html">Engelbart</a>'s oN-Line
				System. The display had the same size and orientation of
				a normal sheet of paper, and used a grid of bitmapped
				pixels for the display. The graphical component was minimal: it only had
				boxes and text as elements and it used the Bravo, a software
				developed to show different kinds of fonts and text
				sizes on the display.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Alto was never sold to the public, even though in
				1981 Xerox started selling the Xerox Star, which had a
				lot in common with the Alto.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Apple Lisa and Macintosh</h2>
				
				
				<a href="#2"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 25%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/lisa.png" alt="the Lisa Office System"><div class="caption">the Lisa Office System</div></div></a>	

								
				<p>
				Apple, inspired by the work of the PARC engineers,
				decided to create its own GUI. In 1983 the <a href="./apple_lisa.html">Apple Lisa</a>
				appeared. While it had a lot in common with the Xerox
				Alto, the Lisa had implemented other functions, like
				icons, which were missing in the Xerox, a single button
				mouse which utilised a double click to open
				applications, and the click and drag. <!--Not sure if grammar is correct in this last one.
				It all depends on what the authoer intended to say...a comma can make a great difference-->
				</p>
				<p>
				Then, in 1984, the <a href="../../hardware/macintosh128k_hw.html">Macintosh</a>
				hit the market. It was a success. Even though
				it wasn't the first computer to have a graphical user
				interface, it was much cheaper than its competitors. The
				arrival of <a href="../../software/os/programs.html">Aldus PageMaker</a> for the macintosh in 1986 and
				the color displays of the Macintosh II amplified the
				success of Apple's products.
				</p>

				<h2>Graphical Environment Manager</h2>
				
				
				<a href="#3"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gem.png" alt="GEM version 1.1"><div class="caption">GEM version 1.1</div></div></a>	

				
				<p>
				Created by Digital Research Inc., the GEM was the
				successor of the GSX, a graphic library whose purpose
				was to permite graphic applications to run on different
				machines that supported it. Using GSX as a basis, GEM
				was supposed to be a program which permitted to have a
				complete graphical user interface on personal computers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first version of the GEM, GEM desktop 1.0, came to
				the market in 1985. It was compatible with CGA and EGA
				displays, and for some machines an 8-bit color version
				was also available. Although it was only supposed to
				work on <a href="../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM machines</a>, 
				due to numerous complaints, this limitation was soon removed. 
				Not much time later, Apple sued DRI because of the strong similarities
				between GEM and the Apple products (namely Lisa and
				Macintosh).
				</p>
				<p>
				As an answer to Apple, in 1986 the second
				version came out, called GEM desktop 2.0. This version had
				graphical differences compared to the older version, meant to
				solve the problem of the similarities with its
				competitors. Additionally, this version had other
				improvements, like bug fixes and the addition of VGA to
				the list of compatible displays. The last commercial
				version of GEM, 3.0, came out in 1988, bringing some
				pre-included applications and a general performance
				upgrade.
