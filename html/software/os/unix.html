				<h2>An Alternative to Multics</h2>

				<p> Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) 
				was a time-sharing <a href="../../software/os/os.html">operating system</a> 
				developed at Bell Laboratories.
				<a href="../../software/companies_people/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a>
				 and <a href="../../software/companies_people/ritchie.html">Dennis Ritchie</a>
				  were among a few who worked on the
				project. In the year 1969,
				 <a href="../../software/companies_people/bell.html">Bell Labs</a> 
				 decided to withdraw from the 
				project and so a small team including Ritchie and Thompson wanted 
				to find an alternative operating system which included the desirable 
				features of Multics. Thus began the creation of UNIX.

				<p>The first edition of UNIX released in 1971 and was used on a DEC PDP-7.
				The power and flexibility of UNIX made it very popular and newer versions 
				were released shortly after.
				A major breakthrough was made in the fourth edition of UNIX, in 1973 as it 
				was now being written in 
				<a href="../../software/software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a>,
				 making it portable (it could be installed into
				almost any computer and translated to the language used in that computer).
				UNIX was also, relatively cheap and this also fuelled its growth in 
				popularity as an operating system.</p>
				
				<p>In 1975, the UNIX version 6 was released and it was the first version
				that could be readily modified by the user. This version of UNIX used the 
				Thompson shell, which would later inspire the interactive C shell.
				The Bourne Shell and C shell were popular features of the seventh edition 
				UNIX, released in 1979 by Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).

				<h2>Variations and Open Systems</h2>
				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				<p>The <a href="../../software/os/xenix.html">XENIX</a> 
				is one of the most well known variations of the UNIX system
				and it was founded in 1980 by <a href="../../software/companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>. 
				In the same year, BSD had released 
				the fourth version of its own distribution of UNIX, called  4BSD.
				The 1980's was a time period when competition between different UNIX
				system products soared and as a result many new versions of UNIX 
				with diffrent features were released in this time period. It was also 
				during this time that AT&amp;T and Bell Labs split, and so the UNIX system
				was once more divided into different variations.
				</p>
				<p>
				The X/Open Company Ltd wanted to design open systems, which meet
				specific standards, which do not depend on the standards of the supplier.
				X/Open decided to use UNIX as the basis of its open systems and hence,
				UNIX was further popularised. In 1987, AT&amp;T along with Berkeley founded
				the Open Software Foundation (OSF) which was another open system.
				During the late 1980's there was immense competition between suppliers of 
				AT&amp;T's UNIX System V and the OSF's variations of UNIX based open systems
				and by 1991, a new company was formed: UNIX System Laboratories. Around
				this period, early versions of Linux (an operating system based on UNIX)
				and Solaris (a version of UNIX for SPARC) were being developed.
