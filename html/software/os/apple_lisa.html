				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				<p>With the <a href="../../hardware/apple_lisa.html">Apple Lisa</a> Applications Development Tool Kit, programmers were able to create Lisa-style programs that extended the system's power even further. The Lisa operating system featured preemptive <a href="../software_engineering/multitasking.html">multitasking</a> and protected memory - extremely advanced features for a personal computer at the time. Partly based on advanced elements from the failed Apple III SOS operating system released three years earlier, the Lisa also organised its files in hierarchal directories, making the use of large hard drives practical. The Macintosh eventually adopted this disk organisational design as well for its HFS filing system. Conceptually, the Lisa resembles the <a href="../../hardware/Xerox_alto.html">Xerox Alto</a> in the sense that it was envisioned as an office computing system. Consequently, Lisa has two main user modes - the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. The Lisa Office System is the <a href="gui.html">GUI</a> environment for end users. The Workshop was a program development environment and was almost entirely text-based, though it used a GUI text editor. The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed "7/7", in reference to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, and LisaTerminal</p>

<h2>LisaCalc</h2>
This function shows a calculator on the screen and can perform calculations.

<h2>LisaDraw</h2>
This function works for drawing.

<h2>LisaProject</h2> 
<p>Lisa project was the first graphical project management software. Developed for the Apple Lisa computer, LisaProject was conceived and implemented by Debra Willrett of SoloSoft and developed for Apple's Lisa computer.


The Lisa operating system features cooperative (non-preemptive) multitasking and virtual memory, then extremely advanced features for a personal computer. The use of virtual memory coupled with a fairly slow disk system makes the system performance seem slow at times.
The Apple Lisa Office System was released in 1983 by Apple Computers with their Lisa microcomputer. The Lisa hardware, <a href="os.html">operating system</a>, and its set of office applications were designed by Apple to work together to create a powerful document processing workstation.

It was collected <!--what?--> because it is representative of a period when the Lisa and the Macintosh competed against each other, with this software marking the terminal period in the life of the Lisa.
