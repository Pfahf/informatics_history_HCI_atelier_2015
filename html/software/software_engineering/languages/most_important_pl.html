				<h1>Some of the most important programming languages</h1>
				<br>
				<h3><a id="1970">1970s</a></h3>
				
				<h4><a id="C">C</a></h4>
					
				<div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width:20%;">
					<a href="#the_c_programming_language"><img src="../images/The_C_Programming_Language_2_ed.png"  class="captionedImg" alt="The C Programming Language (2 edition)"></a>
				</div>
					
					<p>One of the most important and influential programming languages invented at the beginning of the 70s is the C<a href="#c"><sup>1</sup></a> 
					general-purpose compiled programming language designed by <a href="../../companies_people/ritchie.html">Dennis Ritchie</a> 
					between 1969 and 1973 at <a href="../../companies_people/bell.html">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a>. 
					A general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used in a wide variety of applications areas.</p> 
					<p>The creation of C is strictly related to the creation and implementation of the <a href="../../os/unix.html">Unix</a> operating system, 
					which was initially created by Dennis Ritchie and <a href="../../companies_people/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a>, and a few other programmers. 
					C is an imperative, procedural programming language, but it also allows structured programming.</p>
					<p>Although C is a general-purpose<a href="#general"><sup>2</sup></a> language, 
					it was mainly thought as a system programming language, which means that it was thought to create system software, 
					such as operating systems or drivers.</p>
					<p>The language derived mostly from the type-less language BCPL<a href="#bcpl"><sup>3</sup></a> 
					and the B<a href="#b"><sup>4</sup></a> programming language, written previously by Ken Thompson in 1970 at Bell Labs.</p>
					<p>It was static typed to prevent unwanted operations, and it allowed recursion and dynamic memory allocation.
					<p>The C programming language influenced many other programming languages, such as C++, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python or Java.</p>
					<p>1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)<a href="#ansi"><sup>5</sup></a> 
					decided to put together a committee to define a standard definition of the language. 
					The definition ended around 1988, and it was called ANSI C<a href="#ansi_c"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
				
				<h4>Pascal</h4>
					<p>In 1970, another important imperative and procedural programming language that was emerging is the Pascal<a href="#pascal"><sup>7</sup></a> programming language 
					designed by Niklaus Wirth<a href="#niklaus"><sup>8</sup></a>, a member of the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP)<a href="#ifip"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>Pascal was created as a small and efficient language invented to encourage good programming practices 
					using the <a href="languages_paradigms.html#Structured">structured programming</a> and data structuring<a href="#ds"><sup>10</sup></a>, 
					which refers to particular and efficient ways of organizing data in a computer. 
					It was also developed as a vehicle for the teaching of the important concepts of computer programming.</p>
					<p>If you want to learn how to program in Pascal, here's an introductory video (in the video the host uses recent versions of Pascal and of its development tools):</p>

				<h4><a id="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a></h4>
					<p>Around 1972, an insurgent programming language named Smalltalk<a href="#smalltalk"><sup>11</sup></a> came out. 
					Smalltalk was designed and created in part for educational purposes, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC<a href="#parc"><sup>12</sup></a> 
					by <a href="../../companies_people/kay.html">Alan Kay</a>, Dan Ingalls<a href="#ingalls"><sup>13</sup></a>, Adele Goldberg<a href="#goldberg"><sup>14</sup></a>, 
					Ted Kaehler<a href="#kaehler"><sup>15</sup></a>, Scott Wallace. It is an <a href="languages_paradigms.html#OOP">object-oriented</a>, 
					dynamically typed<a href="#dynamic_typed"><sup>16</sup></a> and reflective<a href="#reflection"><sup>17</sup></a> programming language. 
					It was not the first object-oriented language, but it has been one of the most influential object-oriented programming languages.</p>
					<p>It is thought that the first actual object-oriented programming language was Simula 67<a href="#simula67"><sup>18</sup></a>, 
					which has been influencing all the following object-oriented languages, such as Smalltalk or C++.</p>
					<p>Smalltalk was originally used to create prototypes of simpler programming languages 
					and graphical interfaces (GUIs)<a href="#gui"><sup>19</sup></a>. 
					Smalltalk was first run on Xerox’s Alto computer<a href="#xerox_alto_computer"><sup>20</sup></a>, 
					which was designed for it.</p>
						
		
				<h4><a id="Prolog">Prolog</a></h4>
					<p>Between 1972 and 1973, another general purpose and one of the first logic programming languages appeared, 
					Prolog<a href="#prolog"><sup>21</sup></a>. It was originally thought as a natural language processing, 
					which is field of computer science, artificial intelligence<a href="#ai"><sup>22</sup></a>, 
					and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages. 
					Prolog represented a fundamental new approach to computing, 
					and it became a serious competitor to LISP<a href="#lisp"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>The language was first conceived by a group around Alain Colmerauer<a href="#colmerauer"><sup>24</sup></a>, 
					Roussel, and Kowalski, in Marseille, France.</p>
				
				<h4><a id="ML">ML</a></h4>			
					<p>In 1974, Robin Milner<a href="#rm"><sup>25</sup></a> with other collaborators invented the functional ML<a href="#ml"><sup>26</sup></a> programming language. 
					It was designed as the implementation language for LCF<a href="#lcf"><sup>27</sup></a> theorem prover. 
					It was strongly typed, it supported parametric polymorphism<a href="#poly"><sup>28</sup></a> and type inference<a href="#t_inference"><sup>29</sup></a>. 
					This language has also evolved in different dialects over the following years.</p>
				
				<h4>Scheme</h4>
					<p>Scheme<a href="#scheme"><sup>30</sup></a> was created as another dialect of the older programming language Lisp by Guy L. Steele<a href="#steele"><sup>31</sup></a> 
					and Gerald Jay Sussman<a href="#sussman"><sup>32</sup></a>, around 1975. It was developed at the MIT Al Lab<a href="#mit_al_lab"><sup>33</sup></a>, 
					mostly for the academic world via a series of memos. 
					It was t=he first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope<a href="#lexical_scope"><sup>34</sup></a> 
					and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call<a href="#tail_call"><sup>35</sup></a> optimization, 
					giving stronger support for functional programming<a href="#functional"><sup>36</sup></a> 
					and associated techniques such as recursive<a href="#recursion"><sup>37</sup></a> algorithms. 
					It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class<a href="#first_class"><sup>38</sup></a> continuations. 
					It had a significant influence on the development of Common Lisp, the other main dialect of the List programming language.</p>
				
				<h4><a id="SQL">SQL</a></h4>
					<p>A special purpose, <a href="languages_paradigms.html#Declarative">declarative</a> 
					and procedural programming language that came out around 1974 was SQL<a href="#sql"><sup>39</sup></a> or structured query language. 
					SQL was initially developed at IBM<a href="#ibm"><sup>40</sup></a> by Donal D. Chamberlin<a href="#chamberlin"><sup>41</sup></a> 
					and Raymond F. Boyce. 
					It was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, 
					System R<a href="#system_r"><sup>42</sup></a>, 
					which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.</p>
					<p>The original name SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because SEQUEL was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company. </p>
					<p>In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc., 
					which is now called Oracle Corporation<a href="#oracle"><sup>43</sup></a> saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd (a pioneer of the relational model for databases), 
					Chamberlin, and Boyce and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS<a href="#rdbms"><sup>44</sup></a> or relation database management system 
					with the intention of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. Government agencies.</p>

				<h3><a id="1980">1980s</a></h3>
				
					<h4><a id="C++">C++</a></h4>
					
						<p>In 1979, the Danish and British <a href="../../companies_people/Bjarne_Stroustrup.html">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> started developing the compiled object-oriented, 
						imperative and generic C++<a href="#cpp"><sup>45</sup></a> programming language at Bell Labs. 
						The intention of the creator of C++ was to put together the efficiency and the flexibility of the C programming language 
						and high level features for a better and well-organized software production, such as classes of the Simula 67. 
						The language was also influenced by other programming languages, 
						such as ALGO 68<a href="#algo68"><sup>46</sup></a>, Ada or ML. </p>
						<p>C++ was conceived to be strongly typed, and it started supporting many features, 
						such as default arguments<a href="#default_args"><sup>47</sup></a> in functions, 
						virtual functions<a href="#virtual_func"><sup>48</sup></a>, operator overloading<a href="#operator_overloading"><sup>49</sup></a>, 
						references<a href="#reference"><sup>50</sup></a>, 
						constants<a href="#constant"><sup>51</sup></a>, dynamic memory allocation<a href="#dynamic_mem"><sup>52</sup></a> 
						(with the "new" and the "delete" constructs), single-line comments with two forward slashes (//), 
						multiple inheritance<a href="#multiple_inheritance"><sup>53</sup></a> 
						or exception handling<a href="#exception"><sup>54</sup></a>.</p>
						<p>The language was first called by its creator as “C with classes", 
						but the name changed to C++ to emphasize the evolutionary nature of the changes from C, 
						or the addition of new functionality respect to other languages, 
						since the ++ symbol, in the C programming language, is the increment operator.</p>
						<p>Bjarne Stroustrup wanted also to maintain as much as possible backward compatibility with C libraries and modules, 
						that’s why many "dangerous" features of the C programming language were removed.</p>
						<p>C++ has evolved over those years, but without an official version until the late 1990s, 
						but in many versions, which corresponded also to different version of compilers and libraries.</p>
						<p>The first real C++ compiler, written by Bjarne Stroustrup, 
						was an ancestor version of CFront<a href="#cfront"><sup>55</sup></a>, 
						and it was not written in C++, but in C. 
						The new compiler was used to compile the “C with classes” code to C, 
						and then this new language “C with classes” was used to create a more efficient CFront compiler. 
						The new compiler was written in “C with classes”, 
						because writing it with C would have required much more time and effort.</p>
						
						<p>This is the controvert explanation of its creator:</p>

						<p><i>The first C++ compiler (CFront) was written in C++. 
						To build that, I first used C to write a "C with Classes"-to-C preprocessor.
						 "C with Classes'' was a C dialect that became the immediate ancestor to C++. 
						 That preprocessor translated "C with Classes" constructs (such as classes and constructors) into C. 
						 It was a traditional preprocessor that didn't understand all of the language, 
						 left most of the type checking for the C compiler to do, 
						 and translated individual constructs without complete knowledge. 
						 I then wrote the first version of CFront in "C with Classes".</i></p>
						
						<p>Why Bjarne Stroustrup created C++?</p>

					<h4><a id="MatLab">MatLab</a></h4>
					
						<p>A numerical computing environment and its programming language, MatLab<a href="#matlab"><sup>56</sup></a>, 
						which stands for matrix laboratory, was first developed by Cleve Moler<a href="#moler"><sup>57</sup></a> at the University of New Mexico, around 1970s. 
						He designed it to give his student’s access to LINPACK<a href="#linpack"><sup>58</sup></a> and EISPACK<a href="#eispack"><sup>59</sup></a>, 
						both software libraries for algebra and numerical computing. </p>
						<p>Subsequently, around the 1984, MatLab was rewritten by the programmers of MathWorks, 
						that in the meantime had enrolled Cleve Moler as their dependent, using the C programming language.</p>
						<p>By Cleve Moler about the creation of MatLab:</p>
						
						<p><i>When we were developing EISPACK and LINPACK, 
						I was a math professor at the University of New Mexico, 
						teaching numerical analysis and matrix theory. 
						I wanted my students to be able to use our new packages without writing Fortran programs, 
						so I studied a book by Niklaus Wirth to learn about parsing computer languages.</i></p>	
									
						<p>This new language and environment allows matrix manipulations, 
						plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, 
						creation of user interfaces and can also interact with other programming languages, such as C++.</p>
						
						<p>MatLab was revolutionary because it was not invented just for computer scientist, but for all scientist.</p>

				<h3><a id="1990">Late 80s and early 90s</a></h3>
				
					<h4><a id="Perl">Perl</a></h4>
						<p>One of the first web programming languages was Perl<a href="#perl"><sup>60</sup></a>, 
						which was characterized by the wide variety of text processing facilities, 
						regular expression<a href="#re"><sup>61</sup></a> 
						and binary data streams<a href="#bin"><sup>62</sup></a> support. It was interpreted and dynamic. 
						Perl was initially created by Larry Wall<a href="#wall"><sup>63</sup></a> in 1987 at Unisys, 
						but it has evolved in a family of languages over the following years.</p>
						<p>Its founder, before creating it, had already created other compilers. 
						The ideas from those experiences and other languages constructs were put together when creating Perl:</p>

					<br>
					
					<h4><a id="Python">Python</a></h4>
						<p>The idea of creating Python<a href="#python"><sup>64</sup></a> goes back to 1980s, 
						but its implementation was just started in 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands. 
						It was a successor of the ABC<a href="#abc"><sup>65</sup></a> programming language, and the first interpreter for that language was written by Guido.</p>
						<p>This is more or less the initial idea and the premises of the creation of the Python programming language according to its creator:</p>
						<p><i>Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. 
						My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer and not much else on my hands. 
						I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: 
						a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, 
						being in a slightly irreverent mood and a big fan of Monthy Python.</i></p>

						<p>The Hypertext Markup Language or HTML<a href="#html"><sup>66</sup></a> was invented by the physicist Tee Berners Lee at CERN, 
						where the World Wide Web (WWW)<a href="#w3c"><sup>67</sup></a> began its life, 
						as language for sharing data between scientists, and subsequently it became the official language for structuring webpages.</p>
	

					<h4><a id="Oak">Oak</a></h4>
						<p>In 1991, <a href="../../companies_people/vanrossum_goslings.html">James Gosling</a>, 
						Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton started developing a new compiled-interpreted programming language called Oak<a href="#oak"><sup>68</sup></a>. 
						This language was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for that purpose. 
						It was also thought to have as few implementation dependencies as possible; 
						it was thought to be cross-platform through the use of a virtual machine. 
						This language was first implemented in C and C++. Later, Oak was renamed to Java, 
						that would have become one of the most used languages ever.</p>
