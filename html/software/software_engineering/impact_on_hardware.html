				Even though we are talking about hardware primarily here, it's important to remember that the software you will use is the reason you are getting a PC. The hardware is only a means to an end: running the programs that will let you do what you need and want to do. As such, it's important to keep in mind that some programs are more demanding in terms of its hardware requirements than others. The software you are going to use has an impact on the hardware you require
This article is about Intel microprocessor architecture in general. For the <a href="../../hardware/intel_processors80s.html">32-bit</a> generation of this architecture which is also called <a href="../../hardware/intel_processors80s.html">“x86”</a>
<p>In 1975 Moore slowed his forecast regarding the rate of density-doubling, stating circuit density-doubling would occur every 24 months. During the 1975 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting he outlined his analysis of the contributing factors to this exponential behavior As more and more programs enter the realm of firmware, and the hardware itself becomes smaller, cheaper and faster as predicted by Moore's law, an increasing number of types of functionality of computing first carried out by software, have joined the ranks of hardware, as for example with graphics processing units. (However, the change has sometimes gone the other way for cost or other reasons, as for example with softmodems and microcode.)

Most hardware companies today have more software programmers on the payroll than hardware designers, since software tools have automated many tasks of Printed circuit board engineers.</p>
<p>From the software perspective, <a href="../../hardware/intel_processors80s.html">64-bit</a> computing means the use of code with 64-bit virtual memory addresses.
x86-based 64-bit systems sometimes lack equivalents of software that is written for 32-bit architectures. The most severe problem in Microsoft Windows is incompatible device drivers for obsolete hardware. Most 32-bit application software can run on a 64-bit operating system in a compatibility mode, also known as an emulation mode.</p>
<p>A change from a 32-bit to a 64-bit architecture is a fundamental alteration, as most operating systems must be extensively modified to take advantage of the new architecture, because that software has to manage the actual memory addressing hardware. Other software must also be ported to use the new capabilities; older 32-bit software may be supported either by virtue of the 64-bit instruction set being a superset of the 32-bit instruction set, so that processors that support the 64-bit instruction set can also run code for the 32-bit instruction set, or through software emulation, or by the actual implementation of a 32-bit processor core within the 64-bit processor, as with some Itanium processors from Intel, which included an IA-32 processor core to run 32-bit x86 applications.
Counting the Software Lines of Code in a project is a useful, if imperfect, metric to measure the growth of complexity over time in all of the systems we use: from word processors, to operating systems, to automobiles, to robotic spacecraft; the growth trend is clear and consistent </p>
<p>Important events, including thruster burns and instrument activations, also once hard-coded and/or triggered from the ground, can now be software defined and incorporate greater condition-based state in determining activation due to the increase in computational power and memory provided by the hardware.</p>
<p>The wireless telecommunication field has rapidly advanced, from low-gain “bent pipe” one-shot repeater capability of transmissions to the modern digital high-gain, intelligent noise reduction, store-and-forward data transmission, including conditional bandwidth and retransmission features, all made possible through the greater computational abilities at the nodes and upgradable software-defined protocols.</p> 
<p>It is depend on each other. Hardware starts functioning once software is loaded.To deliver its set of instructions, Software is installed on hardware.</p>
<p>To perform the specific task you need to complete. Software is generally not needed to for the hardware to perform its basic level tasks such as turning on and reponding to input.</p>
<p>Software is an ordered sequence of instructions for changing the state of the computer hardware in a particular sequence. It is usually written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to natural language) than machine language. </p>
