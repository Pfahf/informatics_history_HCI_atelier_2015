<h1>Bell Labs</h1>        
<!-- Caratteristiche -->
<p>Bell Laboratories are research and development laboratories. They are a branch of Alcatel-Lucent, a French multinational company. Bell's headquarters are in Murray Hill, New Jersey, United states. </p>
<!-- Storia -->
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Bell Labs was founded by Western Electric Research Laboratories and AT&amp;T's department of engineering in 1925. They joined with the purpose to form  Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc. 
</p>
<p>In the beginning, Bell Labs developed equipment and structures for Western Electric. These were later produced by other companies in Bell's property. 
Since its foundation, Bell Labs made various discoveries in different fields. The most interesting in informatics are the <a href='../os/unix.html'>UNIX</a> operating system, and programming languages like <a href='../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html'>C</a> and <a href='../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html'>C++</a> - also transistors, lasers and other goods.</p>
<p>During the 70s and 80s, Bell concentrated its work in computer science. Their work revolutionized Informatics. In 1970, Dennis Ritchie created the programming language called C, which was then used to rewrite UNIX (before it was written in assembly), another innovative operating system which revolutionized the computer world.</p>
<p> In 1983, Bjarne Stroustrup extended the C language creating C++.<br>
In the middle of the 80s, Bell Labs started a new project called Plan 9. It was a new operating system created from UNIX with the aim of replacing it. Plan 9 was not released until the beginning of the 90s.
</p>
<p>In 1984, due to a divestiture agreement with the U.S. Government, AT&amp;T Corp. divested itself and the Bell System ceased to exist, at least as it was known. During the golden age of Bell labs, over 25,000 people were employed, including 3,300 PhDs.
</p>
<p>The projects developed inside Bell Labs led to 7 Nobel prizes, which reflects the quality of the work done in these laboratories.</p>

<h2> Operating System </h2>

<h3>UNIX</h3>
<p class='subP'>Unix is an operating system developed at Bell Labs. The UNIX operating system exists in many forms. It is characterized by the "Unix philosophy", which means that every command has a defined function, with the presence of a filesystem, shell scripting and a command language.<br> It was originally written in assembly, and eventually rewritten in C. AT&amp;T sold Unix's licenses, which led to the development of many different versions of UNIX.
</p>


<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<h3>C</h3>
<p class='subP'>C is a programming language associated with UNIX OS, which was used for its development. Based on a language called BCPL, before conceiving the C language, engineers created the B Language(1970), which was also used as a base for C.<br>
Having started in 1972, the project was finally published in 1978. In 1983, the American National Standards Institute described a comprehensible definition C.
</p>
    
<h3>C++</h3>
<p class='subP'>C++ is the result of <a href='Bjarne_Stroustrup.html'>Bjarne Stroustrup's</a> PhD thesis. After the Simulta 67 language, Bjarne started working with C, in particular he started working with &ldquo;C with Classes&rdquo;. His purpose was to create an object-oriented programming language based on the C language.<br> 
In 1983, C with classes was renamed C++. Many new features were added, such as virtual functions, function overloading, references (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;), and the ability to insert comments. In 1985, C++ was published and started being sold.</p>
