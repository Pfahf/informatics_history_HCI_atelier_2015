				<h1> Research of new languages</h1>
				<p>
				In the late 80s, the need for new languages ​​to develop software
				in a more accessible way to programmers and to open new horizons rose considerably.

				<p>
				Guido van Rossum, born on January 31, 1956, is a Dutch computer programmer, best know as 
				the author of the <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">Python</a> programming language.
				In 1982, he received a MSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Amsterdam.
				</p>
				<p> 
				In the late 80s, he began a programming project as a hobby to keep him occupied at home
				during Christmas Holidays. He decided to write an interpreter to a new language, and named the project Python
				because it was a bit irreverent and he was a fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
				<br>
				He conceived the Python language, which he began creating in December, 1989, without knowing that he would design a revolutionary language
				</p>
				<p>
				Python is a high-level language focused on the readability of code, with the ability to express concepts
				in less lines of code in comparison to other languages, like Java, or <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C++</a>.

				James Arthur Gosling, born on May 19, 1955, is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the father of the Java programming language.
				<br>
				He obtained a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, Canada in 1977. Subsequently, he received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1983. 
				</p>
				<p>
				He was working at Sun Microsystems in the early 90s, when a research group had been created inside this company to design a
				new language based on the older languages <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a> and C++.<br>
				It was not long before the new language became more complex than the preceding ones, but they also decided to ensure that programs created with this language were compatible with any system.
				For this reason, they developed a virtual machine to create a virtual environment capable of running programs written in Java on any system. The language was initially called <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">Oak</a> but was eventually renamed Java.
