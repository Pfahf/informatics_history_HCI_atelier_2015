				<p><b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b><a href="#"><sup>1</sup></a> born on 30 december 1950, is a Danish computer scientist. He is best known for the creation and development of the programming language <b><a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C++</a> (Cee plus plus)</b><a href="#"><sup>2</sup></a>. Stroustrup received his master's degree from <i>Aarhus university</i> in Denmark, and then went on to receive a PhD in computer science at the famous <i>University of Cambridge, England </i><a href="#"><sup>3</sup></a>, in 1979.

				<h2>Development of C++</h2>
				<p>His most notable work in the computer science field came in 1978, when he started developing C++ (then called <i>C with Classes</i>). It is a general purpose <a href="../software_engineering/languages/programming_languages.html">programming language</a>, which contains imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. It also provides facilities for low level memory manipulation. Bjarne's goal was to add object oriented programming into the <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C language</a>, which is a language well respected for its portability without sacrificing speed or low-level functionality. His version of the language included classes, default function arguments, inlining, basic inheritance and strong type-checking, in addition to all the features provided by the C language.
				</p>
				<p>The compiler for the first C with classes was called <i>Cfront</i><a href="#"><sup>1</sup></a>, derived from the C compiler <i>CPre</i>. Cfront was a program designed to translate C with classes code to ordinary C. However, Cfront was abondoned in 1993 due to the fact that it became difficult to integrate new features (C++ exceptions) into it. Nonetheless, Cfront had a huge impact on the Unix operating system and the implementation of future compilers.</p>
				<p>In 1983, the name was changed to C++. Many new features were also added to the language by this time, the most note-worthy of which are fucntion overloading, virtual functions, references with the &ldquo;&&rdquo; symbol and single line comments using the two forward slashes (taken from the language <i>BCPL</i><a href="#"><sup>5</sup></a>). In 1985, Bjarne's reference to the language, entitled <b>The C++ Programming Language</b><a href="#"><sup>6</sup></a> was published. In the same year, C++ was implemented as a commercial product. The book was a very important reference as the language had not been officially standardized yet. The language was updated again in 1989 in order to include inheritance from several classes - protected and static members followed by the updated second edition of &ldquo;The C++ Programming Language&rdquo; in 1991. In 1990, <b>The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</b><a href="#"><sup>7</sup></a>, written by Margaret Awas, was released. <!--Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup. Why is this here?-->

				<p>Stroustrup has also won several awards, and he is still highly respected in his field. He holds the College of Engineering chair in computer science at the Texas AM University<a href="#"><sup>8</sup></a> and is a visiting professor at the Columbia University.<a href="#"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
