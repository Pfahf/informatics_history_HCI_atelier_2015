				<h1>Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.</h1>
                <p>Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr. is a computer architect, computer scientist and software engineer. Born in April 1931 in North Carolina, he's famous for his work for <a href='../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html'>IBM System/360</a> (Chief Architect) and for the OS/360 software package.<br> Brooks won the National Medal of Technology in 1985 and the Turing Award in 1999. </p>
				<h2>Studies</h2>
<p>In 1953 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science with degree in Physics, and he made his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 1956.</p>
                
				<h2>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
                <q>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</q><br><em>Frederick Brooks </em>
                <p> During his life Brooks published the book <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> in 1975. This book tells about software engineering and project management. Brooks point of view it's based on his work at IBM.<br>A man-month speak about the link between the number of people working on a project and the number of hours that they actually work on it. This linking is know as the Brooks's Law, and is the central part of the book.</p>
                <p>The concept is that on a big project the division of work can not be always perfect, therefore it's important to establish relations and connections between the different project's tasks, which is not always easy to put into practice.<br> In his book Brooks tells that assigning more people to a project which is already delayed on the schedule, will make it even more delayed. This because the new people hired to work on the project will have to learn about what has been done until now with the project, understand what is the aim of the project, and create their own links inside the workgroup.<br> Brooks showed a mathematical formula to understand how many communication channels are needed in a project, which is n(n-1)/2, where n stands for the number of people working on the project, and the output is the communication links. As new people are hired, the communication links increase exponentially, because each person need to create his link with the new hired one, and the new one need to create it's own link with all the others, making the project's communication always more complicated .</p>
