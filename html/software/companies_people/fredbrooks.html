				<h1>Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.</h1>
                <p>Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr. is a computer architect, computer scientist and software engineer. He was born on April 19, 1931, in North Carolina. He is famous for his work for <a href='../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html'>IBM System/360</a> (Chief Architect) and for the OS/360 software package.<br> 
                Brooks won the National Medal of Technology in 1985 and the Turing Award in 1999. 
                </p>

				<h2>Studies</h2>
				<p>In 1953, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and he did his PhD in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 1956.

				<h2>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
                <q>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</q><br><em>Frederick Brooks </em>
                <p> Brooks published the book <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> in 1975. This book talks about software engineering and project management. Brooks point of view is based on his work at IBM.<br>The Mythical Man-Month talks about the link between the number of people working on a project and the number of hours that they actually work on it. This link is know as Brooks's Law, and it is the core of the book.</p>
                <p>The main concept is that the division of work on a big project cannot always be perfect. Therefore, it is important to establish connections between the project's different tasks, which is not always easy to perform in practice.<br> 
                In his book, Brooks states that assigning more people to a project which is already behind schedule will delay it even more. This is because the new people hired to work on the project will have to learn about what has been accomplished until then with the project, understand the aim of the project, and create their own links inside the work-group.<br> 
                Brooks showed a mathematical formula to understand how many communication channels are needed in a project, which is n(n-1)/2, where n stands for the number of people working on the project, and the output is the communication links. As new people are hired, the communication links increase exponentially, because each person needs to create a link with the new hired one, and the new one needs to create his/her own link with all the others, consequently complicating the project's communication links.</p>
